Created based on https://github.com/horovod/horovod/tree/master/examples.


## List of Examples 

### MNIST examples:
      keras_mnist.py
      tensorflow_mnist.py
      pytorch_mnist.py

### ImageNet examples:
     keras_imagenet_resnet50.py
     pytorch_imagenet_resnet50.py

## submission scripts:
    

These examples are based on: https://github.com/horovod/horovod/tree/master/examples. The original examples from Horovod are assumed to be run on GPU. I modified them to be able to run on CPUs.
